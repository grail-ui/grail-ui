						Many companies today are creating their own component libraries and design systems from
						scratch in order to align with their brand and meet the specific needs of their users.
						However, building and maintaining these libraries can be resource-intensive and require
						expertise in areas such as accessibility, keyboard navigation, touch interactions, and
						browser inconsistencies.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the Svelte ecosystem, there are limited options available that can be used as the
						base for building such custom component libraries. Some developers choose to wrap fully
						styled component libraries such as Material UI, but their components can be difficult to
						style and customize to fit specific needs.
					</p>
					<p class="not-prose">
						In recent years, the use of unstyled components (also known as "renderless components")
						has gained popularity in other ecosystems and has now made its way to Svelte. One
						example of this approach is Headless UI, which provides wrapper components with <code
							>&lt;slots&gt;</code
						> for custom HTML and styles. However, this approach has its drawbacks, as the wrapper components
						require the use of custom, non-standard methods for actions, transitions, and composition,
						which may not feel intuitive to Svelte developers.

						Grail UI introduces a fresh approach to building components in Svelte. Our goal is to
						provide developers with a comprehensive library of component primitives, actions, and
						utilities that can serve as the "holy grail" for constructing accessible components,
						design systems, and applications from the ground up with speed and efficiency. We've put
						significant effort into decoupling behavior and accessibility from the DOM structure,
						allowing developers to focus on creating intuitive and user-friendly web experiences.
					</p>
					<p class="font-semibold">
						Grail UI allows developers to retain full control over layout, bindings, and
						transitions, while providing built-in support for behaviors and accessibility. This
						means that you can customize the appearance and functionality of your components to meet
						the needs of your application, while benefiting from the time-saving and user-friendly
						features of our library.
					</p>
					<p>
						Svelte is a powerful framework, and we wanted to enhance it rather than detract from it.
						Grail UI is designed to be lightweight, fast, and easy to compose with other components.
						We believe that our library represents a new and improved way of building components in
						Svelte, and we welcome you to try it out and see the difference it can make for your
						projects.
